# Neural Style Transfer 

This Project is a Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm using the pretrained VGG-19 model in PyTorch. NST blends the content of one image with the style of another. The goal is to optimize a target image (initially the content image) by minimizing a combined loss function that incorporates both content and style losses.

This project is a user-friendly Python GUI application that performs Neural Style Transfer (NST) using PyTorch and VGG19. It allows users to apply artistic styles—like anime, pop art, Ghibli, or even custom artworks—to any image they upload. The GUI is built using Tkinter, and it contain a simple and easy background.

At its core, this application uses a pretrained VGG19 convolutional neural network to extract content and style features from two input images: a content image and a style image. The NST algorithm then generates a third image that blends the visual appearance of the style image with the structure and content of the content image. The entire style transfer process is run in a separate thread to ensure that the GUI remains responsive during processing.
